Wow you got there... Thanks for considering contributing to My Sport Map !

Here are some recommendations to keep the project as clean as possible and thus
nice to work on.

### Quick note

Do not feel restricted by this contributing guide. I am more than open for any
form of contribution and it will not pose any problem if you do not follow
these lines.

## Contributing

I welcome ideas, bug report and any other kind of positive participation in
this project !

If you get an interesting idea for this project, you spot a bug or you want
some fancy new feature, feel free to open an issue. If you want to implement
something to develop this project you're welcome to open a pull request.

Any contribution is welcome !

## Your first contribution

New to contributing ? No worries, I am too !

Here are some resources to learn more from :
- [How to Contribute to Open Source -
  opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [Workflow to contribute to an open source project using git pull requests
  (via GitHub) -
  stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20956154/whats-the-workflow-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-using-git-pull-reque)

## Getting started

Have a look at the [Getting Started üöÄ](./README.md#getting-started-üöÄ) section of the [`README.md`](./README.md).

Try to include tests for new features. You can take a look at the [Running
Tests üß™](./README.md#running-tests-üß™) section of the
[`README.md`](./README.md).

## How to report a bug

### Security disclosures

If you find a security vulnerability, do **NOT** open an issue. Email
nenuphar12@protonmail.com instead.

### Filling a bug issue

When filling an issue, try to answer these questions :

1. What did you do ?
2. What did you expect to see ?
3. What did you see instead ?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

The goal of this application is simply to provide a nice and simple map for
anyone and for free. Any useful ideas are welcome: if you feel like it could be
useful to you, it could be useful to others !

To suggest a new feature open an issue describing the feature you would like
to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code Submission Guidelines

Here are some guidelines for developing this project and preparing your code
before submitting a pull request.

### General Coding Conventions

- follow the `very_good_analysis` linter (ie. check for warnings in your IDE
  and resolve them)
- feel free to use *local* `TODO`s
- add tests for your code (the goal being *100%* coverage)

### Commit Messages

Make your commits small and easy to follow. Write clear, concise commit
messages.

Note that your commits will probably be used to generate the
[`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) file.

Your commits should follow the [Angular commit
conventions](https://github.com/angular/material/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines).

The commit message should respect this format :
> <type>: <subject>

- type must be one of [`build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`,
  `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`]
- `<subject>` is the commit message
  - use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
  - don't capitalize first letter
  - no period (.) at the end

Or for a more complete/complex commit :
> <type>(<scope>): <subject>
> <BLANK LINE>
> <body>
> <BLANK LINE>
> <footer>

- `<scope>` helps specify the scope (or feature) that is changing
  **[optional]**
- `<body>` includes the motivation for the change and contrast this with
  previous behavior **[optional]**
- `<footer>` contains any information about *Breaking Changes* and is also the
  place to reference GitHub issues that this commit *Closes*, *Fixes*, or
  *Relates* to **[optional]**

### Before pushing your code

#### No Errors, No Warnings

There should be no more warnings when you submit your pull request. This is to
facilitate working on the project and find warning and errors when *you* are
coding.

#### No TODOs

You should remove all TODO comments before submitting your pull request.
`TODO`s are meant for you to review some code before submitting a pull request.

and learning ! So join me and try too ! üçª*
